# CV Application

To help start off my journey into ReactJS I created a CV application that can take a users input and then display it in an HTML view. I made this to help learn how to use state and props and how to both lift state up and down. I also looked into conditional rendering to help handle the switch between the editing view to the html preview view of the application. 

I broke down the main items of the application into components (Header, Personal, Education, Practical, Switch). The switch was broken into a component due to being used in more than one area on the application in the editing view and was in an attempt to start thinking in React.
